# Number Guessing Game

## Overview

This project is a simple console-based Number Guessing Game implemented in Java. The game prompts the user to define a range of numbers, generates a random number within that range, and then allows the user to guess the number. The game provides feedback on each guess (whether it is too high, too low, or correct) and counts the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number.

## Features

- **User-Defined Range:** The player sets the lower and upper bounds of the guessing range.
- **Random Number Generation:** The program generates a random number within the specified range.
- **Feedback on Guesses:** The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- **Attempt Tracking:** The number of attempts made by the player is tracked and displayed upon guessing the correct number.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures that the user inputs valid numbers and that the upper bound is greater than the lower bound.
